Simple Python script to show how the WinWing F/A-18C hornet UFC can be used in conjunction with Elite Dangerous.

Basically uses the excellent work, and particularly the initial demo script, from llamaXc to display whatever you want (within DCS Hornet constraints) on the UFC option select displays https://github.com/llamaXc/winwing-ufc-addon/releases/download/V1.0.18/wwt.zip. 

Simply open SimAppPro, then run the WinWingED_menu_v2.py script. 

In this initial version, the function mode keys are used to select between different menus. When used in conjunction with Voice Attack (.vap profile file included), this can make the option select buttons act as different keyboard hotkeys inside Elite Dangerous. Initial made the script emulate key presses from within Python, but don't have much time to debug USB jitter issues I was getting. Therefore I'm pushing it out there because I don't have time to continue working on it, but thought others might like to use it, or run  with it.
